# Word-Autocomplete-App
Java app that uses Trie data structures to read in a large file of text and create a dictionary of words that can be queried to autocomplete a word. 
Autocomplete ranking is based on frequency of the word in the text. Frequency in the sense it auto-completes the word which is used more frequently.
